### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/influencerflowai.git # Replace with your repo URL
   cd influencerflowai
   ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
3.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
   ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4.  **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **🚨 CRITICAL: Create Backend Environment File (`backend/.env`)**
    Ensure you are in the `backend` directory.
    Copy the contents of `env.example` (if it exists and is relevant to backend) or create a new `.env` file with the following variables:

    ```env
    FLASK_APP=app.py
    FLASK_DEBUG=True # Set to False in production

    # Supabase (replace with your actual credentials)
    SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    # For backend operations that need admin-like privileges (e.g., initial setup, migrations):
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" 
    # OR if using user context for all backend ops via JWT:
    # SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" # Used if RLS is primary mechanism

    # Groq AI (replace with your actual key)
    GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"

    # Twilio (replace with your actual credentials)
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID"
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"
    TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER" # Must be E.164 format (e.g., +1234567890)

    # ElevenLabs (optional, for AI voice)
    ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="YOUR_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"
    ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID="YOUR_PREFERRED_ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID" # e.g., "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"

    # IMPORTANT FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT WITH TWILIO:
    # This must be your ngrok HTTPS forwarding URL when running locally.
    # Example: https://xxxxxxxxxxxx.ngrok-free.app
    BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL="" 

    # Other backend specific configurations (e.g., database URLs if not using Supabase for everything)
    # SECRET_KEY="your_flask_secret_key_here" # For Flask session management if needed
    ```

6.  **Setup ngrok for Local Development (if using Voice Calls):**
    If you are developing the voice call features locally, Twilio needs a way to send webhook requests (like call status updates or speech input) back to your local Flask server. `ngrok` exposes your local server to the internet.
    - Start your Flask backend (next step). Let's assume it runs on port 5001.
    - Open a new terminal and run: `ngrok http 5001`
    - `ngrok` will give you a "Forwarding" HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abcdef123456.ngrok-free.app`).
    - **Crucially, update the `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL` in your `backend/.env` file with this HTTPS URL.**
    - Your Twilio webhook configurations (e.g., for `/api/voice/handle_user_speech`) will be `[YOUR_NGROK_URL]/api/voice/handle_user_speech`.

7.  **Run the Flask Backend:**
    ```bash
    flask run --port 5001 # Or your preferred port
    ```
    Ensure your `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL` in `.env` is correctly set if using ngrok.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the root project directory (if you're in `backend`, go up one level):**
    ```bash
    cd .. 
    ```
    (Or, from a fresh terminal, `cd influencerflowai`)

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **🚨 CRITICAL: Create Frontend Environment File (`.env` at the project root)**
    Create a `.env` file in the main project root (alongside `package.json`) with the following:

    ```env
    # Supabase (Frontend needs Anon Key)
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"

    # Backend API URL
    # For local development, if backend is on port 5001:
    VITE_BACKEND_API_URL="http://localhost:5001"
    # If using ngrok for backend AND you want frontend to talk to ngrok URL directly (less common for local dev):
    # VITE_BACKEND_API_URL="YOUR_NGROK_HTTPS_URL" 
    ```
    **Note:** `VITE_BACKEND_API_URL` is used by the frontend to make API calls to your Flask backend. For local development, this is typically `http://localhost:5001`. The `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL` in the *backend's* `.env` is for Twilio to reach your backend.

4.  **Run the React Frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    The frontend should now be running (typically on `http://localhost:5173` or another port shown in the terminal).
